## General info
This project is developed using WordPress. Pure coding is involved without the use of Page Builder. Advanced Custom Field (ACF) is used to develop the custom fields and page templates. Resuable blocks are created which are created that can be used globally or specific to a page/post/page-template. Minimum use of plugins and maximum optimization is taken in consideration during the development of this project.
